The amount of Paid Star per Watched Hour is high because the game mostly played by streamers. But the game doesnâ€™t have a high average of Paid Star per Watched Hour.
Means the amount of Paid Star per Watched Hour is not based on the most game played.

There are more male streamers than female streamers. It affect the total of Paid Star per Watched Hour, but in average Female Streamers gain more Paid Star per Watched Hours than male streamers

### Recommendation
For new streamers they can stream game with the highest game played to improve their exposure and gain more quantity in watchers. Play such as MLBB, PUBG or Free Fire
For experienced streamer we should encourage them to play game with high average paid star per watched hour such as UFC 3 in Indonesia, League of Legends in Philippines and MLBB in Vietnam. Because they already have their own followers so they need more the quality not the quantity.

As the system paid more star for female streamers, the company should find more talents for female streamers than male streamers
